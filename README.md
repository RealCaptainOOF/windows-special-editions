# windows-special-editions
Windows special editions, including Windows 11 SE and Windows 10 S.


Hello! This is a list of publicly available ISOs from Microsoft, that aren't available to consumers.
Feel free to experiment with them! They aren't my property anyways.
If you are looking to change editions on your current Windows, I'd recommend [Microsoft Activation Scripts](https://github.com/massgravel/Microsoft-Activation-Scripts) for this.
It is recommended to NOT try to install one of the following ISOs from this list, as most of them are hidden from the public for a reason. Run the ISOs in a VM with a tool like [VMWare Workstation](https://vmware-player.en.uptodown.com/windows/download) or [Oracle VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.en.uptodown.com/windows).
